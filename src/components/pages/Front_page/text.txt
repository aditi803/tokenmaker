                        The ERC-20 introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens,
                        which means that each Token has a property that makes it
                        identical to another Token (in terms of type and value).
                        An ERC-20 Token, for example, functions similarly to
                        ETH, meaning that one Token is and will always be equal
                        to all other Tokens.

                        can be utilized. It is an extension of the ERC-20 token
                        standard and can be used to represent shares or fiat.

                        Supply can be adjusted later on by minting or burning
                        tokens if you chose those options. You won't be able to
